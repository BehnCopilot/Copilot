GitHub Copilot is a cloud-based artificial intelligence tool developed by GitHub and OpenAI to help users of Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Neovim and JetBrains integrated development environments (IDEs) autocomplete code. This tool is designed to make programming easier by offering autocomplete style suggestions as you write code.

## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to human or animal intelligence. AI can be defined as a set of algorithms and techniques that seek to mimic human intelligence. It is used in a wide variety of applications, such as advanced search engines, recommender systems, speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, and generative or creative tools.
